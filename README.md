Usually shadom dom's are pain for testing. With code like raptor now its very easy to create scripts which penetrates shadom dom like a bullet.

This will also ease creating scripts for multiple features in seconds.

Now anyone without having knowledge of technical jargons can write tests.

Follow below steps and you are good to go.

1) Crete test-script.json

eg) [
      {
        "stepName": "navigate to url",
        "action": "navigate",
        "time": 2000,
        "locator": "document.querySelector()",
        "url": "'https://www.alodokter.com/'"
      },
      {
        "stepName": "click Cari Dokter",
        "action": "click",
        "time": 2000,
        "locator": "document.querySelector()"
      },
      {
        "stepName": "click city scan",
        "action": "click",
        "time": 2000,
        "locator": "document.querySelector()"
      },
      {
        "stepName": "click Doktor",
        "action": "click",
        "time": 2000,
        "locator": "document.querySelector()"
      },
      {
        "stepName": "input value",
        "action": "input",
        "time": 2000,
        "locator": "document.querySelector()",
        "inputValue": "'test'"
      }
    ]
